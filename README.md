# Spectral Batch Normalization &mdash; unofficial PyTorch implementation 

Unofficial implementation of a normalization layer from paper
[Spectral Batch Normalization: Normalization in the Frequency Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16999)

Some notes from the paper: 
- Use SBN layer after BN layer
- Use SBN layers in deeper blocks of model
- ...
